calkKinematics contains all the Python code.
main_wPy contains all the Arduino code.

These two folders contain all the code you need to run the system. Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino and run the main code on a PC with the Arduino connected to it.

Simulation contains both simulation models. The Simulink file contains the advanced one, the matlab file contains the basic one. One shows the movement, one shows the input position. The default movement defined on the advanced model is rotation in all three rotaitional degrees of freedom and no translational movement.
